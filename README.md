# Applied Mathematics (PINN)

This repository contains assignments from the **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)** lecture taken as part of the Applied Mathematics course during my undergraduate studies at **Konkuk University (2024)**. This lecture was offered as part of my second major in **Mathematics**.

## Overview

The repository is organized to save and document various assignments from the course, including:

- **Python Programming Problems**: Fundamental exercises to build proficiency in Python, focusing on mathematical and numerical applications.
- **Statistics for Machine Learning**: Statistical methods and tools essential for machine learning applications.
- **Machine Learning Tasks**: Basic ML problems to understand and implement key concepts of PINN.

## About the Course

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a cutting-edge approach that leverages deep learning to solve problems governed by physical laws, typically represented by partial differential equations (PDEs). This course introduced the foundations of PINN, bridging applied mathematics with modern computational techniques.
